    "bio": "I'm Yogesh, fondly known as faujibryant, a highly skilled Software Developer specializing in React.js, currently residing in Janakpuri, New Delhi. My formative years were shaped by my father's dedicated service in the Army, instilling in me the values of discipline and commitment. I did my schooling at Army Public Schools in Udhampur(J&K), APS Dhaula Kuan and APS Delhi Cantt. I earned a Bachelor of Engineering degree(Information Technology) from the prestigious Army Institute of Technology in Pune, affiliated with Savitribai Phule Pune University. My career began at Trendsetters Skill Assessors Pvt. Ltd. as a Frontend Developer, where I honed my skills in React.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Redux, Material UI, Bootstrap, Enzyme, Jest, Git, SQL, and other technologies. Afterward, I joined Vaionex APAC, focusing on blockchain and AI technologies, enhancing my skills in React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Supabase, Notion, and various JavaScript/React/Next.js libraries, as well as deployment platforms like Vercel. Currently, I am with a firm developing web portals and other applications for Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL), New Delhi. My web development skills led me to explore freelancing opportunities, where I garnered valuable experience in both frontend and backend development. I have also represented Pune District Basketball team and South West Delhi teams in senior-level competitions for Basketball, Netball, and Korfball, and have actively volunteered for social causes too. Being a sportsman, I understand the value of team-spirit and is never discouraged by failure but is always eager to learn more every day. I'm seeking a role that aligns with my extensive skill set and experiences, offering competitive compensation and substantial growth opportunities & I am open to freelance opportunities. Thankyou for your time",
